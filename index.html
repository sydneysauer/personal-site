                <br><br>
                I'm a computer science student with a Spanish minor, and I'm obsessed with learning, creating, 
                and inventing. In the past, I've worked as a freelance writer and a math tutor (and a smoothie chef, for what it's worth). 
                Now, I'm finally starting my first internship in computer science.
                <br><br>
                At Ohio State, I received the Eminence Fellowship, a prestigious full cost of attendance merit award
                given to the top students in each class. I'm also involved in ACM-W, an organization promoting women 
                in computer science, and currently working on creating a food waste reduction nonprofit. Both causes 
                are important passions of mine.
            </p>

            <p class="list-head">Code</p>
            <p>During summer 2020, I am working as a frontend web development intern for 
                <a href="https://www.jbhunt.com/freight-shipping-solutions/dedicated/technology/" class="focus">
                    JB Hunt Transport</a>, where my team is using Angular to redesign their commercial site's UI. 
                </p>

                It's my dream to get an internship at a high-tech startup. If you're looking for a web or

            <p class="list-head">Writing</p>
                <p>I've always had a special aptitude for communication, and I've worked as a freelance writer since I was
                15 years old. Currently, I spend my time writing for 
                <a href="https://www.leveluptutorials.com/" class="focus">Level Up Tutorials</a>, 
                a popular web development tutorial site with courses crafted by

                host 
                <a href="https://www.scotttolinski.com/" class="focus">Scott Tolinski</a>. 
                My responsibilities include crafting bimonthly emails on the latest web development tips 
                and tricks, as well as writing blog posts about technology such as GraphQL and Figma.
                <br><br>                 
                After three years of ghostwriting, my work also appears in bizarre places on the internet. Most notably, my

                sales include over 250 articles on tech, business, landscaping, and more. In addition to these anonymous
                pieces, my work has been published on:
