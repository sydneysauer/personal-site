                I'm a computer science student obsessed with learning, creating, and inventing. In the past, 
                  I've worked as a freelance writer and a math tutor (and a smoothie chef, for what it's worth). 
                  Now, I'm finally starting my first internship in computer science.
                  <br><br>
                  At Ohio State, I received the Eminence Fellowship, a prestigious full cost of attendance merit award
                  given to the top students in each class. I'm also involved in ACM-W, an organization promoting women 
                  in computer science, and currently working on creating a food waste reduction nonprofit. Both causes 
                  are important passions of mine.
