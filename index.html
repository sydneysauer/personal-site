                    <br><br>
                    I'm a computer science student with a Spanish minor, and I'm obsessed with learning and creating. In the past, 
                    I've done everything from freelance writing to test prep tutoring. 
                    Currently, I'm starting my first internship in computer science.
                    <br><br>
                    At Ohio State, I received the Eminence Fellowship, a prestigious full cost of attendance merit award
                    given to the top students in each class. I'm also involved in ACM-W, an organization promoting women 
                    in computer science, and currently working on creating a food waste reduction nonprofit. Both causes 
                    are important passions of mine.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not hard at work, you can find me listening to music on Spotify, going for a run, or spending
                    time with my favorite people.

                    <p>I've always had a special aptitude for communication, and I've worked as a freelance writer since I was
